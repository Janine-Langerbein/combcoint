## Overview

`combcoint` is an `R` package which provides, among other things, the
*combined non-cointegration tests* of Bayer and Hanck. The following
cointegration tests are implemented:

-   `bayerhanck()` to perform the *Combining non-cointegration test*
    which is implemented in two different versions.
-   `boswijk()` performs the structural error correction model
    cointegration test by Boswijk
    [(1994)](https://doi.org/10.1016/0304-4076(93)01560-9)
-   `banerjee()` performs the error-correction-based cointregration test
    by Banerjee [(1998)](https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-9892.00091)
-   `englegranger()` performs the residual-based cointregration test by
    Engle and Granger [(1987)](https://doi.org/10.2307/1913236) and is a
    wrapper for the `ur.df` of the `urca` package
-   `johansen()` performs the system-based maximum likelihood
    cointegration test by Johansen
    [(1988)](https://doi.org/10.1016/0165-1889(88)90041-3) and is a
    wrapper function for the `rank.test` of the `tsDyn` package. Note
    that first the transformation to a VECM is needed.

## Installation

<!--
You can install the released version of combcoint from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:


```r
install.packages("combcoint")
```
-->

The development version can be downloaded from
[GitHub](https://github.com/jens-klenke/combcoint) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jens-klenke/combcoint")
```

## Usage

First install the package as described above

``` r
# example data from the MTS package 
data("mts-examples", package = "MTS")

bayerhanck(sp ~ ibm + ko, data = ibmspko, lags = 1, trend = "const", test = "all")

banerjee(sp ~ ibm + ko, data = ibmspko, lags = 1, trend = "const")

boswijk(sp ~ ibm + ko, data = ibmspko, lags = 1, trend = "const")

englegranger(sp ~ ibm + ko, data = ibmspko, lags = 1, trend = "const")

johansen(sp ~ ibm + ko, data = ibmspko, type = "eigen", lags = 1, trend = "const")
```
